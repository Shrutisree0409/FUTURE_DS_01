## 📌 Task Overview

**🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)**

Before importing the data into Power BI, extensive data cleaning and preprocessing was performed in Microsoft Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency of the analysis. The raw dataset underwent the following transformations:

Sorted and filtered data to remove inconsistencies

Removed blank spaces and handled missing values

Standardized date formats for proper time-based analysis

Created a new Revenue column using calculated fields

Removed unnecessary and invalid records (e.g., Unit Price = 0)

Deleted redundant columns and irrelevant rows

Ensured data quality for accurate visualization and insights

This preprocessing step helped in building a reliable and meaningful Power BI dashboard based on clean, structured data.
